            <p class="meta">Talmud Ketubot 31b</p>
            <p class="aside">The Talmud then notes that Mishnah Makkot 3:1 states that in the same list of scenarios where a man rapes a relative, the man is lashed. However, it is an established principle in Rabbinic law that a person cannot be both lashed and forced to pay a monetary penalty for the same crime.</p>

Ulla also made contributions to the Babylonian talmud. He was a student of R.

                <p class="explanation">In the first case, because the man must pay a fine to the girl's father, he is not lashed. In the second case, because there is no fine paid to the father, lashes are the appropriate punishment.</p>

                            <p class="explanation">In both the case of personal injury and in the case of <em>edim zommemim</em>, given the possibility of both fines and lashes, the offender only pays the fine. Therefore it can be extrapolated that in all scenarios the fine takes precedence over lashes.</p>
                            <p class="rejection">Another commonality between the personal injury and <em>edim zommemim</em> is that they are exceptional cases — the personal injury fine is five-fold and <em>edim zommemim</em> do not need a warning — so you cannot extrapolate anything from them.</p>

                            <p class="explanation">Deuteronomy 22:29 refers to a man raping a virgin having to pay a fine "for he has violated her." Exodus 21:24 says that in cases of assault, the compensation must be "an eye for eye." Because both verses use the Hebrew word "tachas" as the word "for," the anonymous Talmudic editor speculates that Ulla might have concluded that because in the case of assault, monetary fines takes precedence over lashes, that principle also applies in the cases of sexual violation.</p>

                    <p class="explanation">Deuteronomy says "The judge shall cast him down and lash him...in accordance with his wickedness. Forty [lashes] he shall strike him." Because wickedness is a singular noun and it is followed by a count of lashes, the Talmud infers that lashes take precedence.</p>
                    <p class="rejection">In the cases of personal injury and <em>edim zommemim</em>, fines take precedence over lashes.</p>

                                        <p class="explanation">Lev. 24:19 says "if a man inflicts a wound in his fellow, as he did so shall it be done to him." Lev 24:20 says "just as he gave a would in person, so shall it be given to him." The second phrase is deemed superfluous and is there to teach that the punishment involves something that is given: money.</p>

                    <p class="answer">Accepting Ulla would mean annulling the law "the nakedness of your sister you shall not reveal." (Lev. 18:9)</p>
                    <p class="explanation">Lev 18 says that in all cases of incest, the man must be lashed for seeing his sister naked.
